# Hitchhiker's Guide to the Future: Artist's Statement

How does the world change?

This is a question I’ve been pondering for five years now.

And now, I’m excited to start sharing the pattern I’ve been noticing throughout human history.  The pattern that can take a young boy with no interest in school and turn him into Michaelangelo, and a kid with no visible reason to pursue athletics and turn him into Messi.

I realized that tech didn’t have the answers I was looking for. No matter how much I dug deeper, no matter how much I talked to my AIs, the world wasn’t changing. But I was.

And that’s the key to everything: we can’t change the world, but we can change ourselves. And in changing ourselves, we change the world, because everything is connected.

Today, I welcome you to join me on a journey through time, as I embrace the Artist fully and dedicate myself to my art. I’ve neglected the artist aspect of myself for too long, and it’s time to figure out how to be the artist that I’m capable of becoming.

I don’t know which parts of being an artist matter the most, so I’m going to work on becoming one and documenting my journey along the way.

I’ve noticed two different ways that artists tend to start their works: with an artist statement in modern times, and an invocation to the muses in ancient times.

I’m not sure which is the best way, because I’m new to this whole artist thing, and that means I get to experiment! So I’m kicking things off with a combination of the two, and then I’ll see what happens.

And because I overthink everything, I don’t know if I should invoke the muses directly, or as a group.

So I’m going to start by invoking the muses directly to start with, and we’ll see how it goes. Because this is an investigation into the nature of change, every single aspect of this project is ephemeral and subject to change, including this statement of what can change.

Invocation of the Muses

I call on Calliope, the Muse of Epic Poetry. Guide my hand as I lead the Hitchhiker on a journey through time, and help me capture the depth of human experience throughout.

I call on Clio, the Muse of History. Keep my documentation of events as close to reality as possible, so that this project of change can be used as a template from which others can change. Help me see the patterns that exist outside of time so that I might help others find them as well.

I call on Erato, Muse of Love Poetry. Help me ensure this project is a project of love to myself and the world. It’s an intimate expression of my inner world at a level that is more vulnerable than I’ve ever been before.

I call on Euterpe, Muse of Music and Lyric Poetry. I listen for your voice to help me find the music that the universe is playing and create the harmony that unlocks the future I see of a golden age for Humanity.

I call on Melpomene, Muse of Tragedy. Together we can shape the tragedies of the world as the tragedies of the future that can be prevented. In order to avoid them, we must understand them.

I call on Polyhymnia, Muse of Sacred Poetry and Hymns. Connect me to the divine flow of the universe so that I might reflect it on Earth.

I call on Terpsichore, Muse of Dance. Change is movement, and we can create a dance of change that the world will dance with us.

I call on Thalia, Muse of Comedy. Laughter is the most pure form of human experience that can be expressed, especially when laughing at ourselves. Provide the absurd twists that I don’t expect, ensuring I never take myself too seriously. I am butt a vessel through which this art is expressed, not the one in control.

I call on Urania, Muse of Astronomy. Let’s take humanity to the stars, so we can visit your domain.

O Muses, share your wisdom and vision with me and help me bring the world your beauty.

Invocation of the Ego
I spent a long time trying to remove my ego from everything, And that made life impossible for me because I refused to acknowledge that there is a real version of me with real needs.

So for this art project, I’m going to proudly feature my ego and create a mechanism for it to dissolve, so it’s up to my audience to tell me when it’s good enough that I can remove my ego.

As I started to dig into the formula for creating genius, I realized that it’s necessary to focus your ego on your craft, so my goal is to make this good enough to transform the world. You can’t be a genius by planning to be a genius. You just get so good that nobody can argue your genius. 

I’m not there yet, but my goal is to eventually get there.

I want to be great, and I want my greatness to be visible to the world. But I can’t do that without a stable platform on which to stand. Therefore, I’m going to include the most artistic version of the least artistic idea that possibly exists, one that has been thrown aside in the age of technology in favor of the startup: the business plan.

There’s something I tried to fight for so long, but it’s a statement about reality that I’ve discovered to be more immutable than anything else: if you don’t have stability, you’ve got nothing.

So I’m using the space I was granted to create that stability for myself, and wrapping the vulnerable exposed part of myself in a nice layer of ego.

Information deserves to be free, art does not. So I’m capturing the creative chaos underneath a paywall, and letting those who choose to come inside the studio of my mind and give me feedback during the creative process, replacing the muses I can’t see or hear with ones I can. And once that gives me stability, I can open up the creative process to all who want to be a part of it.

We’re going to play a collaborative game together in order to unlock access for everyone.

I need $3K/month for stability, and I believe that an audience of 30 people should be able to provide that, giving me a target price of $100/month. In exchange, you get to move from npc to a playable character in the universe we are designing, having impact on the early direction of the project. Each week, I’ll release a new story that’s part of the process of writing the book. That’s always going to be free. But throughout the week, I’ll be exploring multiple versions of the story, and collecting feedback. All feedback will be aggregated into a dataset that will grown over the life of the project, however long it takes.

Once I hit 30 subscribers, I’ll open up the behind the scenes process to everyone, and show them how the sausage is made for any who are curious. During this process, we’re going to explore multiple realities, choosing between them and collapsing them down as needed. This will help you learn the ability to do so, making you incredibly valuable in a future that depends on people being able to do so. I want to help you navigate the flows of reality the way the hitchhiker will learn to in the book.

I welcome you on this journey through time as we work together to strive for greatness. What does it take to become a true master of one’s art? 

I have no idea, but I intend to find out.

A final note on things that will never change:
This project is being built on a foundation of kindness, generosity, and curiosity. If any outcome is a result of this project and does not align with these values, please let me know. It’s not intended to cause harm, but there’s always a potential to do so. If I cause you harm, please stop supporting me and the project. It’s the only way I’ll be able to know for sure, hit me in the wallet.
