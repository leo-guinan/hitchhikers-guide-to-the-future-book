The First Death in the Innovation Nexus
Chapter: The Terrible Gift of Infinite Possibility
The machine looked like Leonardo had gotten drunk with a clockmaker and then invited an alchemist to the party just to see what would happen. Brass gears the size of dinner plates meshed with delicate crystal spheres containing what appeared to be liquid mercury that defied gravity, flowing upward in lazy spirals. The whole contraption was held together by a wooden frame that seemed to have grown rather than been built, with living vines somehow incorporated into the mechanism, their leaves trembling with each tick of the escapement.
"So, uh, Leo—can I call you Leo?" The hitchhiker wiped sweat from his forehead, still wearing the rough apprentice garb that itched in places he didn't know could itch. "This looks super safe and not at all like something that's going to turn my insides into my outsides."
Leonardo da Vinci, looking far less like a wise Renaissance master and more like a mad scientist who'd discovered coffee five centuries early, grinned with the enthusiasm of someone about to show you their extensive collection of dangerous reptiles. "Safety? Sicurezza? Bah! Safety is for those who wish to die in their beds, having discovered nothing!"
"Right, cool, cool. Counterpoint though—dying in bed sounds pretty nice compared to being atomized by your steampunk fever dream here."
"Atomized!" Leonardo's eyes lit up. "What a delightful word! From the Greek atomos, yes? Indivisible! Though I suspect from your casual use that your era has discovered otherwise." He began scribbling notes with his left hand while adjusting a valve with his right, because of course he could do that. "Tell me, do atoms truly split in your time?"
"I—wait, no, we're not doing this. You're not getting future spoilers out of me while I'm about to step into your death machine."
"Death machine? This is a portal, my young friend. A window! A doorway into the space between spaces, where all workshops across all time exist as one!" Leonardo pulled a lever, and the machine began to hum with a frequency that made the hitchhiker's teeth ache. "Though I suppose death is simply another kind of doorway, no?"
"That's not as reassuring as you think it is!"
The mercury in the spheres began to glow, casting shifting shadows that seemed to move independently of their sources. The apprentices in the workshop had all found urgent business elsewhere—apparently, they'd seen enough of Leonardo's experiments to develop a healthy sense of self-preservation.
"Now," Leonardo said, his wild hair even wilder in the crackling energy beginning to arc between the brass components, "when you enter the Nexus, you must remember three things. First—"
"Wait, there are rules? Why didn't you mention rules before—"
"First! You can shape reality there, but reality shapes back. It is like clay that is also the potter."
"That makes literally no sense—"
"Second! Your thoughts become manifest, but so do your fears, your doubts, your—how do you say—your psychological damage?"
"My what? I don't have psychological damage! I'm from the future, we have therapy!"
Leonardo paused, giving him a look that suggested he'd just claimed water wasn't wet. "Everyone has psychological damage. It's what makes us interesting. Now, third and most important—"
The machine reached a crescendo, the wooden frame groaning, the vines writhing, the gears spinning so fast they appeared to move backward. A tear in reality opened in the center of the contraption, revealing not another place but another kind of place—somewhere that looked like a workshop built by M.C. Escher during a particularly aggressive fever.
"Third!" Leonardo shouted over the noise. "Do not, under any circumstances, try to reshape fundamental constants! I tried to make pi equal to exactly 3 once. I was inside-out for a week!"
"WHAT?!"
But Leonardo had already shoved him forward.

The Innovation Nexus felt like falling in all directions at once while also standing perfectly still. The hitchhiker's brain tried to process what he was seeing and promptly filed a complaint with management.
The space was a workshop, yes, but a workshop that existed in defiance of euclidean geometry. Workbenches curved through dimensions that shouldn't exist, their surfaces somehow both above and below themselves. Tools hung in mid-air, but also in mid-time—he could see the same hammer being forged, used, broken, and reforged simultaneously.
"Okay," he said to himself, his voice echoing in ways that suggested the echo came first. "Okay, this is fine. This is totally fine. I'm in an impossible space that exists outside normal reality. Leonardo warned me about this. Sort of. In the way that saying 'watch out for that bear' technically warns you about a bear attack."
He took a step forward and found himself moving through what felt like temporal molasses. Not slower, but thicker, as if time itself had viscosity here. Around him, ghostly figures worked at their crafts—was that Archimedes? And there, someone in a lab coat that wouldn't be invented for centuries, and beyond them, a figure working with tools that seemed to be made of solid light.
"Reality shaping," he muttered. "I can shape reality here. That's what Leo said. So let's start simple."
He concentrated on his hand, imagining it holding something useful. A smartphone would be nice. Just a little taste of home, a familiar—
The phone materialized instantly, but it was wrong. It was a phone as understood by someone who'd never seen one, interpreted through Renaissance sensibilities. The screen was made of polished crystal, the apps were tiny painted portraits that moved when touched, and instead of a battery, it appeared to be powered by a miniature water wheel that shouldn't fit inside the case but somehow did.
"Okay, that's... actually kind of cool."
He touched one of the painted apps—a messenger pigeon holding a scroll—and suddenly understood. The Nexus didn't just let you shape reality; it shaped your shaping through the lens of where you were in your understanding. He had the knowledge of smartphones but was thinking through the context of the Renaissance. The result was this beautiful, impossible hybrid.
"I could make anything," he realized, and that's when the trouble started.
Because the moment he thought "anything," the Nexus heard "everything."
Reality began to respond to every stray thought, every unconscious desire, every suppressed fear. A workbench sprouted wings because he'd absently wondered if it could fly. A saw began cutting through the air itself, leaving bleeding gaps in space because he'd thought about how sharp things could theoretically cut anything. His reflection in a polished surface winked at him with eyes that weren't his because some deep part of his brain always worried he wasn't really himself.
"No, no, no! Stop! Cancel! Control-Z!"
But the Nexus didn't have an undo function. It only had a "yes, and—" function.
His panic made things worse. The floor became uncertain because he felt uncertain. Gravity started negotiating its intensity because he couldn't decide if he wanted to run or stay still. And in the corner of his vision, his fears began to take shape—every moment of impostor syndrome, every anxiety about not being good enough, every deep-seated terror that he was going to fail—all of them becoming real, becoming solid, becoming hungry.
"Leonardo!" he screamed. "You forgot to mention the part where this place EATS YOU!"
But Leonardo was back in normal reality, probably painting something serene while his latest victim was being psychologically disassembled by an interdimensional workshop.
The hitchhiker tried to focus, to remember the lessons about foundations and patience and understanding. But it's hard to be philosophical when your own materialized self-doubt is literally trying to consume you. It looked like him but wrong—features twisted by every moment he'd looked in a mirror and hated what he saw.
"You're not real!" he shouted at it.
"Neither are you," it replied in his voice. "You're just a collection of borrowed ideas and stolen knowledge, pretending to be someone who matters."
And the worst part? Part of him believed it.
That belief gave it power. It grew stronger, more solid, while he felt himself becoming less so. The Nexus was showing him a fundamental truth—in a place where thought became reality, self-doubt was suicide.
He could feel himself unraveling, his consciousness spreading thin across the infinite workshop. He was becoming part of the Nexus itself, another ghost among the makers, forever trapped between existence and idea.
This is it, he thought. This is how I die. Not heroically, not even interestingly. Just dissolved by my own neuroses in a place that shouldn't exist.
But then, in that moment of absolute dissolution, something clicked.
If self-doubt could destroy him, then maybe...
"I am," he said quietly, then louder, "I AM."
Not "I am smart" or "I am worthy" or any qualification. Just the pure assertion of existence.
"I AM," he repeated, and felt himself solidifying. "I exist. I am here. I am learning. I am allowed to fail because failure is how learning happens."
The shadow-self hesitated.
"You're not my enemy," he told it. "You're my teacher. You're showing me what happens when I let fear drive. But I don't have to let you drive."
The shadow-self smiled—his smile but kinder—and stepped back into him. Not destroyed, but integrated. Acknowledged.
The Nexus stabilized around him. The chaos remained, but organized chaos, like jazz or controlled demolition. He could feel the shape of it now, the patterns Leonardo had tried to warn him about.
He reached out with his mind, carefully this time, and shaped a simple wooden chair. It appeared, solid and real and exactly what he'd imagined. No interpretations, no modifications. Just a chair.
He sat down hard, exhausted in ways that had nothing to do with physical effort.
"Okay," he panted. "Okay. Note to self: the Innovation Nexus requires therapy first, reality-shaping second."
Around him, the ghostly figures of makers throughout time continued their work, and he could swear some of them were smiling. They'd all been here. They'd all faced this trial.
He was about to try standing when he noticed something. The chair he'd made—it was wrong. Not obviously, but wrong in a way that was about to become very obviously—
The chair exploded.
Not like a bomb. Like an idea that suddenly remembered it had never learned how to be a chair. The wood became concept became nothing, and he fell through the space where it had been, through the floor that was only floor because he believed in floors, through the Nexus itself, falling out of reality like someone had forgotten to code collision detection.
The last thing he heard before everything went black was Leonardo's voice, somehow reaching through dimensions:
"Ah yes, I forgot to mention—never sit on your first creation. It's like... how you say... a rule?"

He woke up in the bottega, Leonardo standing over him with a cup of something that smelled like paint thinner mixed with regret.
"Drink," the master said. "It will help with the temporal nausea."
"I died," the hitchhiker croaked. "I literally died. The chair murdered me."
"No, no," Leonardo corrected cheerfully. "The chair revealed you murdered yourself. Very different! Also, you didn't die. You just... stopped being momentarily present. Death is much more permanent. Usually."
"Usually?!"
"The Nexus is forgiving to beginners. One free death, as a learning experience. Like... what is your expression? A tutorial?"
The hitchhiker stared at him. "You knew. You knew I'd die and you let me go anyway."
"Of course! How else would you learn? Besides," Leonardo's eyes twinkled with manic glee, "everyone dies their first time. It's tradition! Mine was particularly embarrassing—I tried to make the perfect woman and she gained consciousness just long enough to tell me all my flaws before we both exploded."
"That's... dark."
"That's the Nexus! Now," Leonardo pulled him to his feet, the world spinning slightly, "ready to try again?"
The hitchhiker looked at the machine, still humming ominously, portal still open to that impossible space where thought became reality and reality fought back.
"Can I at least get some armor or something?"
"Armor? Against your own mind?" Leonardo laughed. "My friend, that's called 'wisdom,' and I'm afraid it only comes from experience."
"Experience being a euphemism for repeated death?"
"Now you're learning!"
The hitchhiker sighed, straightened his itchy apprentice robes, and approached the portal again. This time, at least, he knew what he didn't know. That had to count for something.
"Hey Leo?"
"Yes?"
"Next time someone asks you about the Innovation Nexus, maybe lead with 'it will kill you with your own insecurities' instead of burying that in the footnotes?"
Leonardo considered this. "But where would be the fun in that?"
As he stepped through the portal again, the hitchhiker couldn't help but think that the real lesson of the Renaissance wasn't about art or science or innovation.
It was that all the great masters were absolutely, certifiably insane.
And apparently, to navigate the Innovation Nexus, he'd have to become one of them.
