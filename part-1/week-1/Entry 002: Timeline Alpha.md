# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Future: Entry 002
## Timeline Alpha - The Workshop Discovery (Wild Version)
### Florence, 1492 (Sort Of)

*[Monday Edition - For Navigators Only]*

*[Previous Entry: Our Navigator discovered that Columbus wasn't the real innovation center of 1492 - the transformation was happening in a workshop in Florence...]*

The smell hit me first. Then the second smell. Then the third, fourth, and—wait, that's not how smells work.

"Unless," I thought, stepping through what should have been a door but felt more like a membrane made of calculus, "you're in a workshop that exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously."

Verrocchio's bottega occupied the ground floor of a building that was somehow between a bakery and a cloth merchant while also being above them, below them, and occasionally inside them. The laws of physics had apparently taken a sick day.

"Oh great, another one," said Leonardo.

"Another *what*?" asked a different Leonardo from across the room.

"Time traveler, probably," said a third Leonardo, not looking up from dissecting what appeared to be a wing attached to a mathematical equation. "We get like three a week now."

"Four," corrected a fourth Leonardo, who was somehow younger than the others. "You're forgetting the Swedish guy."

"That wasn't time travel, that was just bad mushrooms," argued Leonardo Prime—or at least the one wearing a name tag that said 'Hello My Name Is The Original Probably.'

I counted seven Leonardos. No, eight. Wait, seven again. One of them kept phasing in and out of existence.

"Okay," I said slowly, "this is new."

"Is it though?" Leonardo Prime walked over, wiping his hands on a rag that was simultaneously clean and dirty until observed. "Is anything really *new*? Or is everything just happening all at once and we're too three-dimensional to notice?"

"That's... actually pretty close to the truth."

"I know." He grinned. "I've been to the future. Also the past. Also the sideways. Turns out time isn't a river, it's more like..." He paused, gesturing vaguely. "You know when you spill wine on a manuscript and it soaks through multiple pages at once?"

"Time is... wine stains?"

"Time is wine stains." He nodded sagely. "Want to see something cool?"

Before I could answer, he grabbed my arm and pulled me toward what I'd thought was a painting but turned out to be a window. Through it, I could see another workshop. In that workshop, another Leonardo was showing another me the same window, through which we could see another workshop, where—

"Stop looking or your brain will leak out your ears," Leonardo advised. "Happened to Leonardo-6 last Tuesday. Well, *a* Tuesday. Time gets weird here."

"How?" I managed. "How is this possible? It's 1492!"

"Is it though?" Leonardo-3 called out. "I've got a calendar that says it's 1756."

"Mine says stardate 4729.8," added Leonardo-5.

"Mine just has a picture of a duck," said the phasing Leonardo sadly.

Leonardo Prime shrugged. "Turns out when you really understand perspective in art, like *really* understand it, you start seeing perspective in everything. Including time. And once you see it..." He snapped his fingers. The workshop rotated 90 degrees through a dimension I didn't know existed. My stomach tried to crawl out through my spine.

"You can change it," he finished.

"This is insane."

"No, it's innovation." He led me to a workbench covered in sketches that moved when I wasn't looking directly at them. "Every great breakthrough happens when someone notices reality is just one option among many. Watch."

He picked up what looked like a normal paintbrush, dipped it in what looked like normal paint, and drew a door on what looked like a normal wall. Then he opened it. Through the door, I could see myself from five minutes ago, just arriving.

"See, the thing about innovation centers," Leonardo Prime explained, casual as anything, "is they're not places. They're probability consciousnesses—wait, that's not the right word. Probability *consciousnesseses*? Consciousni?"

"Just say nexus points," suggested Leonardo-2, who was arm-wrestling Leonardo-4 while Leonardo-7 took bets.

"Right, nexus points. Where all the timelines touch. That's why you time travelers always end up here. It's not the *when* that matters, it's the *what if*."

My head was spinning. Or the room was. Hard to tell. "I'm looking for patterns. Seven specific—"

"Oh, THOSE patterns." All the Leonardos said it in unison, which was deeply unsettling. "Yeah, we figured those out."

Leonardo Prime walked to a wall covered in what I'd thought was a fresco but now realized was a living equation. "Pattern one: Someone funds transformation without understanding it. That's Lorenzo. He thinks he's buying art but he's actually buying reality modifications."

"Pattern two," continued Leonardo-3, "safe space for dangerous experiments. This workshop exists in a pocket dimension. Very safe. Mostly."

"Pattern three!" shouted Leonardo-5. "Different disciplines forced together. We've got art, science, magic—"

"Magic isn't real," interrupted Leonardo-2.

"Magic is just science you don't understand yet," Leonardo-5 shot back.

"Science is just magic that's repeatable," added the phasing Leonardo.

"ANYWAY," Leonardo Prime continued loudly, "Pattern four: direct master-to-student transmission. Verrocchio taught me, I teach myself, myselves teach themselves—it's very efficient."

"Pattern five is the competition between innovation centers," said Leonardo-6, manifesting fully for a moment. "Florence, Milan, Venice, but also"—he gestured at the infinite workshop windows—"all the other timelines trying to out-innovate each other."

"Six is society allowing change," added Leonardo-4. "The Renaissance isn't just happening, it's happening because everyone agreed to stop pretending things can't change."

"And seven," all the Leonardos said together again, "networks that amplify discoveries."

They pointed to the corner where I finally noticed what I should have seen immediately: a massive tangle of what looked like copper tubes and glass spheres, pulsing with light. Inside the spheres, I could see other workshops, other innovations, other timelines. Ideas were flowing between them like—

"Like wine stains through pages," I whispered.

"Now you're getting it!" Leonardo Prime clapped. "Every innovation that happens here ripples out through the network. That's why your enemy keeps trying to destroy workshops. Cut one node and—"

"Wait, you know about the enemy?"

All the Leonardos laughed. It sounded like a Renaissance choir having a breakdown.

"Know about them?" Leonardo Prime grinned. "Buddy, they're right behind you."

I spun around. Standing in the doorway I'd entered through—which was now somehow on the ceiling—was another figure. They looked exactly like me. Except for the eyes. The eyes were older. Much older.

"Hello," said the other me. "I'm you from Timeline Zeta. I'm here to stop you from making the worst mistake in the history of every timeline."

"Which is?"

"Teaching Leonardo about time travel." Future-me gestured at the Leonardos. "Look what happens! He doesn't just innovate, he innovates across all timelines simultaneously. He breaks causality!"

"That sounds... bad?"

"Bad?!" Future-me laughed bitterly. "In my timeline, Leonardo invented Facebook in 1494. *FACEBOOK!* Do you have any idea what the Renaissance is like with social media?!"

Leonardo Prime perked up. "Facebook? What's that?"

"NO!" Both me and future-me shouted.

But it was too late. I saw the look in his eyes—all sixteen of his eyes across eight bodies. The idea had taken root.

"A book of faces..." he mused. "Where people could share their thoughts and paintings... across distances instantly..."

The workshop started vibrating. The infinite windows began showing different timelines—all of them sprouting Renaissance-era social networks. In one, Michelangelo was livestreaming painting the Sistine Chapel. In another, Machiavelli had gone viral with a dance video.

"You IDIOT!" Future-me screamed. "You've doomed us all! Again!"

"Again?"

"This is like the fourth time we've had this conversation! Every time you come here, you break time differently!"

The vibrating intensified. Leonardos were starting to merge and split randomly. The smell was now all smells and no smells simultaneously.

"How do I fix this?" I shouted over the increasingly loud humming that sounded suspiciously like a dial-up modem.

"You have to leave! NOW! Before the timeline crystallizes!"

"But the patterns—"

"The patterns are a TRAP!" Future-me grabbed my shoulders. "They're not instructions for innovation, they're instructions for breaking reality! Every innovation center that learns all seven patterns becomes—"

They were cut off as Leonardo Prime suddenly appeared between us. Except now he had wings. Actual, functional wings.

"Sorry, were you saying something important?" He asked innocently. "I was busy evolving past the need for linear time. Oh, and I solved that whole 'death' problem. Turns out it's optional. Who knew?"

The workshop exploded. Or imploded. Or maybe it just shifted perpendicular to reality. Either way, I was falling through timelines like a marble through a Jenga tower made of probability.

I caught glimpses of other workshops—Newton teaching calculus to cavemen, Einstein running a food truck in ancient Egypt, Stephen Hawking arm-wrestling Aristotle—before landing hard on cobblestones.

London. 1665. The plague year.

I could smell it. Just one smell this time. Thank god.

"Note to self," I muttered, standing up and brushing off my clothes. "Maybe don't teach Renaissance polymaths about quantum mechanics."

Above me, the stars were wrong. Some of them were URLs.

Leonardo had broken something. Something big.

And somehow, I had to fix it before teaching Newton about gravity. While my future self was probably trying to stop me. And Leonardo was apparently now some sort of time god.

Just another Tuesday in the timeline wars.

## Navigator's Note - Timeline Alpha
*[For Paid Navigators Only]*

Okay, so that got weird. Maybe too weird? 

This version tests:
- Multiple versions of the same person (Leonardo paradox)
- Self-aware meta humor about time travel
- Reality breaking as comedy vs horror
- How much Rick and Morty energy is too much?
- Whether the enemy being future-self works

**Questions for you:**
1. Is this entertaining or just confusing?
2. Should we keep the multiple Leonardos?
3. Is the humor landing or undermining the story?
4. Do the seven patterns still come through clearly?
5. Should Leonardo actually break reality or is that too far?

Tomorrow's version will be MUCH more traditional. Unless you tell me to make it weirder.
