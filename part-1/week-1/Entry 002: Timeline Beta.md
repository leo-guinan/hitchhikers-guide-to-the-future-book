The smell of linseed oil and fresh-ground pigments guided me through Florence's narrow streets. After three days of searching, I'd finally found it: Verrocchio's bottega, tucked between a bakery and a cloth merchant near the Arno.

I paused at the entrance, adjusting my merchant's clothing. My story was simple: a Dutch trader interested in commissioning a piece. My Italian was passable, my purse heavy enough to open doors. The enemy agent could be anywhere, anyone. I had to be careful.

The workshop door stood open to the April air. Inside, I counted seven apprentices at various tasks‚Äîgrinding pigments, transferring cartoons to panels, mixing gesso. The rhythmic scraping of pestles created an almost musical pattern. Three beats, pause, five beats, pause, eight beats. Interesting.

"You seek the master?" A young man approached, perhaps twenty years old, wiping his hands on a leather apron. His eyes were sharp, intelligent, curious. 

"I seek quality," I replied in careful Italian. "I represent certain interests in Amsterdam. We've heard Verrocchio's workshop produces the finest art in Florence."

"The master is overseeing a bronze casting at the Palazzo," the young man said. "But perhaps I can help. I'm Leonardo, one of the senior apprentices."

Leonardo da Vinci. Even at twenty, before the fame, before the masterpieces, there was something about him. The way he studied me, as if memorizing every detail for later sketching.

"I'm particularly interested in your workshop's methods," I said, letting my merchant mask slip slightly. "I've heard you combine techniques that others keep separate."

His eyebrows rose slightly. "An unusual interest for a merchant."

"I've found that understanding how excellence is created helps me recognize it when I see it." I pulled out my purse, hefty with florins. "May I observe your workshop? I'll pay for the disruption."

Leonardo glanced at the other apprentices, then back to me. "Come. I'll show you something."

He led me past the main workspace to a smaller room in the back. The walls were covered with sketches‚Äîhuman anatomy, architectural designs, strange machines I recognized as primitive flying devices. On a central table lay a dissected bird wing beside detailed drawings.

"You study more than art," I observed.

"Art is the study of everything." He picked up the wing carefully. "How can I paint an angel's wings if I don't understand how a bird's wings work? How can I sculpt a man if I don't know what lies beneath his skin?"

"And Verrocchio approves of this... diversification?"

"Master Verrocchio understands that excellence comes from unexpected combinations." Leonardo gestured around the room. "Here, painters learn from sculptors, sculptors from engineers, engineers from anatomists. We don't just copy what came before. We create what hasn't existed."

I felt the timeline shimmer slightly. This was it‚Äîthe innovation center's heart.

"Show me," I said.

For the next two hours, Leonardo walked me through the workshop's methods. It was revolutionary, though he didn't use that word. While other workshops jealously guarded their techniques, Verrocchio's apprentices shared knowledge freely within these walls. A painter's observation improved a sculptor's accuracy. An engineer's mathematics refined an artist's perspective. 

"We have a saying here," Leonardo explained. "'Every master was once a disaster.' Verrocchio encourages us to fail, to experiment, to push beyond the possible."

"And your patrons accept this experimentation?"

Leonardo's expression darkened slightly. "Lorenzo de' Medici understands that innovation requires investment without immediate return. Not all patrons are so wise."

As he spoke, I noticed something: the other apprentices had unconsciously arranged themselves in a specific pattern around the workshop. Each at their station, but connected, like nodes in a network. When one needed ultramarine, another provided it without being asked. When someone struggled with a technique, help appeared wordlessly.

"You work as one organism," I said.

"We work as Florence works," Leonardo corrected. "Connected, competing, collaborating. What we discover here spreads to other workshops through the apprentices who move on. What they discover elsewhere, they bring back. Knowledge flows like the Arno‚Äîsometimes fast, sometimes slow, but always moving."

"And you? What do you discover?"

He was quiet for a moment, then moved to a covered canvas in the corner. "I'll show you something I haven't shown the master yet."

He pulled away the cloth, revealing a small painting. It was a Madonna, but unlike any I'd seen. The background showed not the flat gold of tradition but a landscape with actual depth, actual atmosphere. The figures seemed to breathe.

"I call it sfumato," he said quietly. "Like smoke. No lines, just transitions. The way we actually see."

The timeline shivered again, stronger. This technique would revolutionize art, but more than that‚Äîit would change how humans understood perception itself.

"It's remarkable," I said honestly.

"It's dangerous." A new voice from the doorway. An older apprentice stood there, his face suspicious. "Leonardo, you know the guild has rules about innovations. And showing them to strangers..."

"Pietro," Leonardo said calmly. "Our visitor is a patron, not a spy."

Pietro's eyes narrowed at me. Something in his gaze made my skin crawl. Was this the enemy agent? Or just protective tradition?

"The guilds exist for a reason," Pietro said. "Too much change, too fast, and everything collapses. We've seen it before. Constantinople. Rome. Great cities that thought they could innovate without limit."

"And now they're gone," Leonardo countered. "While we, who embrace change, flourish."

The argument felt rehearsed, like they'd had it many times. But underneath Pietro's traditional stance, I sensed something else. Fear? Or calculation?

"I should go," I said, standing. "I've taken enough of your time."

Leonardo walked me to the door. As we passed through the main workshop, I counted the pattern again. Three beats, pause, five beats, pause, eight beats. The apprentices weren't conscious of it, but they were maintaining a mathematical rhythm. Fibonacci's sequence, though that wouldn't be named for another ten years.

"Come back tomorrow," Leonardo said at the door. "The master will have returned. And perhaps..." he glanced back at Pietro, who was watching us intently, "perhaps I'll have more to show you."

I nodded, pressing a few florins into his hand. "For your time."

As I walked back through Florence's streets, I processed what I'd learned. The seven patterns were all there:

1. Lorenzo's patronage without understanding
2. The workshop as protected experimental space
3. Multiple disciplines forced together
4. Master-to-apprentice knowledge transmission
5. Competition between Florence's workshops
6. A cultural moment allowing change
7. Networks spreading discoveries

But there was something else. Pietro's hostility felt different from mere traditionalism. The way he'd said "Constantinople" and "Rome"‚Äîlike he knew their falls intimately.

Tomorrow I would return. Leonardo would show me more innovations. And perhaps I'd discover whether Pietro was simply a conservative apprentice, or something far more dangerous.

The sun was setting over the Arno. Somewhere in this city, the enemy agent was moving their own pieces. But here, in Verrocchio's workshop, the future was being born one experiment at a time.

No broken timelines. No multiple Leonardos. Just human brilliance pushing against the edges of the possible.

Sometimes that's enough to change everything.

## Navigator's Note - Timeline Beta
*[For Paid Navigators Only]*

So... the complete opposite of yesterday.

This version tests:
- Pure historical fiction approach
- Zero science fiction elements (beyond narrator's knowledge)
- Traditional narrative structure
- Subtle pattern introduction
- Realistic character interactions

**What I kept:**
- The seven patterns (but woven naturally)
- Leonardo as innovator
- Workshop as innovation center
- Enemy agent possibility (Pietro?)
- Setup for Newton/London

**What I removed:**
- Multiple timelines
- Reality breaking
- Meta humor
- Explicit time travel mechanics
- Anything overtly weird

**Questions for you:**
1. Is this too boring after yesterday's chaos?
2. Does the historical accuracy feel more grounding or limiting?
3. Is Pietro as potential enemy more interesting than future-self?
4. Should we keep the Fibonacci rhythm or is it too subtle?
5. Do the seven patterns come through clearly enough?

Tomorrow's version will try to find a middle ground. Unless you want me to go even MORE traditional (Leonardo doesn't even paint, just grinds pigments for three pages) or return to the chaos dimension.

Vote in comments:
üìö = Keep it traditional like this
üé® = Back to weird
‚öñÔ∏è = Find the perfect middle
üé≠ = Try something completely different

Also: Which Leonardo do you prefer? Multiversal god-being or earnest young artist?

**Remember: Friday's readers only get one timeline. You're choosing which one becomes "real."**

*Timeline Gamma tomorrow: What if we split the difference?*

**THE FUTURE IS WHAT WE MAKE IT. CHOOSE WISELY.**
