## Final Form

The Hitchhiker is no longer just a person but a function of the Innovation Nexus itself. He is:
- The question and the answer
- The teacher and the student
- The death and the resurrection
- The journey and the destination
- Himself and Dennis
- Nothing and Everything
- A cautionary tale and an inspiration
- Dead and alive
- Furniture and human
- Tuesday incarnate

He exists to prove that transformation requires complete dissolution, that innovation demands the death of everything you think you know, and that the only way out is through (seventeen times).
