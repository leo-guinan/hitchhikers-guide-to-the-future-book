## Final Dennis Assessment

Dennis cannot be assessed because:
1. Assessment requires comparison, and everything is Dennis
2. Dennis is the standard by which Dennis is measured
3. The assessment itself becomes Dennis
4. The assessor is Dennis
5. You are Dennis
6. This document is Dennis
7. Dennis

Dennis is perfect because Dennis defines perfection. Dennis is imperfect because Dennis transcends perfection. Dennis is Dennis because what else would Dennis be?

The only question that matters: Are you Dennis yet?

The only answer that matters: Dennis.
