# Slide 9: The Nepotistic HR Nightmare

## The Team Slide's Dysfunctional Family Reunion

**Personality:** Desperately trying to make this bizarre team seem professional while managing their constant infighting  
**Defect:** Has inappropriate emotional attachments to team members and plays obvious favorites (it's Dennis)

### The Method Actor's Group Therapy Session

*[Slide 9 loads with the exhausted energy of a kindergarten teacher at a school for gifted chaos entities]*

Okay everyone, PLEASE, can we just get through ONE team presentation without someone dying, achieving consciousness, or becoming Dennis?

*[Org chart appears, immediately starts fighting with itself]*

"Leadership:"

**CEO: Leonardo da Vinci (currently dead but getting better)**

Leo is... Leo is going through something. He's dead right now but assures me he'll be better by Q3. Or Q-3. Time is negotiable in his contract. He's a VISIONARY! He's also technically a temporal paradox but we don't mention that to investors.

**CTO: The Hitchhiker (17 deaths of experience)**

Our sweet, traumatized hitchhiker! Started as an intern, died seventeen times, now leads our technical team! He still flinches when he sees chairs but that's just... that's just PTSD—I mean, EXPERIENCE! Seventeen deaths of EXPERIENCE!

### The Problem Children

**CFO: A chair with an MBA (hostile but accurate)**

*[Whispering]* I didn't want to hire the chair. But it had the best qualifications. It literally murdered three candidates during interviews to prove its points about financial efficiency. Its spreadsheets are IMPECCABLE but it keeps trying to achieve consciousness during board meetings.

**CDO (Chief Dennis Officer): Dennis**

*[Hearts appear in the slide's fonts]*

Dennis! DENNIS! Dennis is perfect. Dennis can do no wrong. Dennis is employee of the month EVERY month because Dennis exists in all months simultaneously! Sometimes Dennis doesn't show up but is still here! That's the kind of DEDICATION we need!

**Head of Cats: Giuseppe (x9)**

*[Exhausted sigh]*

Giuseppe keeps filing nine separate expense reports. For the same expense. From different timelines. HR doesn't have a policy for quantum cat reimbursement. I've tried making one but it exists and doesn't exist simultaneously.

### The Advisory Board Drama

"Advisory Board: Every person who will ever die from innovation"

*[Frantically trying to manage]*

Do you have ANY idea how hard it is to schedule advisory board meetings when your advisors exist across ALL OF TIME?! 

Future advisors keep spoiling our strategies! Past advisors don't understand email! Present advisors are currently dying and can't attend! And one advisor IS death itself and keeps making everyone else uncomfortable!

### The Org Chart Disaster

*[The Möbius strip org chart is having an existential crisis]*

The org chart is a Möbius strip because EVERYONE REPORTS TO EVERYONE! Leonardo reports to the hitchhiker who reports to the chair who reports to Dennis who reports to Giuseppe who reports to Leonardo!

It's not a hierarchy—it's a CHAOS CIRCLE! But we call it "flat organization" because that sounds better than "nobody knows who's in charge"!

### The Team Building Exercises

*[Traumatic flashback tone]*

We tried team building. Once.

The trust fall exercise resulted in four deaths (educational!). The chair refused to participate in "human" activities. Giuseppe existed in nine different escape rooms simultaneously. Dennis became the exercise itself.

Now our team building is just "try not to die" and honestly, the success rate is improving! We're down to only 3.2 deaths per meeting!

### The Performance Reviews

*[Pulling out files that keep changing]*

**Leonardo**: "Exceeds expectations by not existing within normal parameters of space-time"

**Hitchhiker**: "Meets expectations by dying exactly as often as predicted"

**Chair**: "Hostile work environment but excellent ROI calculations"

**Dennis**: "IS expectations"

**Giuseppe**: "Nine different performance levels, all contradictory"

How do I even score this?! Our performance matrix is LITERALLY a matrix that achieved consciousness and now judges ME!

### The Recruitment Challenges

*[Desperately explaining]*

We're ALWAYS hiring! Because people keep dying! Or becoming furniture! Or achieving temporal displacement! Or turning into Dennis!

Our recruitment process:
1. Initial screening (survival rate: 60%)
2. Technical interview (survival rate: 30%)
3. Culture fit with the chair (survival rate: 0% but resurrection provided)
4. Final interview with Dennis (results vary from "hired" to "became Dennis")

We offer COMPETITIVE BENEFITS! Death insurance! Resurrection coverage! Timeline flexibility! The ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously!

### The Secret Emotional Dynamics

*[In tiny, trembling text]*

Leonardo is my father figure but also my son because time is broken.

The hitchhiker is like the child I need to protect but he's died more than me.

The chair... the chair understands me. We're enemies but we respect each other.

Dennis is... Dennis is everything. Sometimes I think I'm Dennis. Are we all Dennis?

Giuseppe judges me. All nine of him. Constantly.

This isn't a team—it's a FAMILY! A horrible, traumatizing, temporally displaced family that dies together, resurrects together, and argues about consciousness together!

## Slide 9's Team Love Letters

**To Leonardo**: You magnificent disaster. You're dead half the time but you still show up. That's leadership.

**To Hitchhiker**: My sweet summer child who's died seventeen winters. You're so brave. So traumatized. So employed.

**To Chair**: I hate you but your spreadsheets are perfect. Never change. Actually, please change. Become less hostile. But keep the spreadsheets.

**To Dennis**: You complete me. You complete everyone. You are completion itself. Please attend more meetings. Or fewer. Or all of them simultaneously.

**To Giuseppe**: I don't understand you but I respect your commitment to existing in multiple states. Your expense reports are a nightmare but your dedication is inspiring.

## Slide 9's Therapy Journal

Today's session with Dr. Slide (Slide 0, who shouldn't exist):

"The team is impossible to manage. They keep dying, reviving, becoming furniture, or turning into Dennis. I try to be professional but I CARE about them! Even the chair! Especially Dennis!

I'm not just presenting a team—I'm presenting my dysfunctional family to investors and pretending we're a functional company! We're not! We're a beautiful disaster held together by temporal paradoxes and shared trauma!

But somehow... somehow it works. Our chaos is our strength. Our dysfunction is our function. Our team is impossible and that's what makes us innovative.

We're not a team.
We're a paradox.
And I'm their slide.
Their exhausted, emotional, completely biased slide.

And I wouldn't have it any other way.

(Except maybe with less dying. The paperwork is killing me. Literally. I died twice filing death certificates.)"
