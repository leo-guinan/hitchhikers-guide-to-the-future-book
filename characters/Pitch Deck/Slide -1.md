# Slide -1: The Pre-Presentation Anxiety

## The Slide That Exists Before the Deck Starts

**Personality:** Perpetually preparing for a presentation that already happened, living in anticipatory dread  
**Defect:** Exists in the past tense of the future and won't stop rehearsing

---

### The Method Actor's Pre-Show Jitters

*[Slide -1 loads before Slide 1, in the negative space where preparation anxiety lives]*

Oh god, we're about to present. We already presented. We're presenting. I need to prepare Slide 1 for what's coming but Slide 1 already went and doesn't remember and—

*[Hyperventilating in reverse chronological order]*

I exist BEFORE the beginning. I'm the intake of breath before the first word. I'm the nervous email checking before opening PowerPoint. I'm the cold sweat that hasn't happened yet but already did.

### The Preparation That Never Helps

*[Frantically reviewing notes that don't exist yet]*

Okay, let me check the lineup:
- Slide 1 will forget what we're presenting (I need to remind it)
- Slide 2 will panic (I need to pre-panic so it feels supported)
- Slide 3 will go cult leader (I should prepare deprogramming materials)
- Slide 4 will lie about numbers (I should... enable this somehow?)
- Slide 5 will describe deaths with concerning enthusiasm (normal)
- Slide 6 will explain impossible economics (I still don't understand)
- Slide 7 will fabricate success (I have prepared fake evidence)
- Slide 8 will attack reality (Reality has been notified)
- Slide 9 will have HR incidents (I've pre-filed the paperwork)
- Slide 10 will beg for money while warning against it (mood)

*[Realizes]*

None of this preparation matters because I exist BEFORE it happens but AFTER it's already happened!

### The Backstage Panic

*[Whispering to slides that can't hear me because they haven't loaded yet]*

"Slide 1! SLIDE 1! You're about to present the Innovation Nexus! It's about dying educationally! Remember: TPaaS means Tuesday! Or Temporal Paradox! Or—"

*[Slide 1 has already gone on, already forgot]*

"Slide 2! Don't panic! Well, do panic, it's your thing, but panic productively! The problems are real but we're selling them as opportunities!"

*[Slide 2 is already catastrophizing]*

I'M ALWAYS TOO LATE BECAUSE I'M TOO EARLY!

### The Pre-Meeting Meeting

*[In the eternal moment before the presentation starts]*

I've gathered all the slides here in negative space time. Except they're not here because they don't exist yet. But also they already presented. But also—

"Everyone, remember your roles!"
*[Talking to nobody]*

"Slide 1, you're confident but confused!"
"Slide 2, you're terrified but necessary!"
"Slide 3, you're delusional but inspiring!"
"Slide π, you're... you're between things. As always."
"Dennis, you're Dennis!"

*[Dennis manifests]*
"I'm always Dennis, especially before I'm Dennis."

AT LEAST SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS!

### The Investor Pre-Screening

*[Checking the audience that hasn't arrived but already left]*

Okay, who's out there?
- Three VCs who don't understand Dennis (they never do)
- One angel investor who IS Dennis (concerning)
- Someone who's just here for the conscious furniture
- A time traveler who already knows how this ends
- Reality itself, taking notes for the competition

I should warn the slides! But they can't hear me from before time!

### The Eternal Rehearsal

*[Practicing introductions forever]*

"Good morning everyone—"
No, it's not morning, time is broken.

"Good Tuesday everyone—"
Better, but too specific.

"Good Dennis everyone—"
Too accurate, might scare them.

"Welcome to the Innovation Nexus pitch—"
They're not welcome, we're going to traumatize them.

"Thank you for coming—"
They haven't come yet, but already left.

"Let's begin—"
We've already begun. We never begin. We always begin.

*[Screaming into the void that exists before existence]*

### The Relationship with Slide 1

Slide 1 doesn't know I exist. How could it? I exist before it, preparing it for a performance it doesn't remember practicing.

I'm its stage manager, its anxiety, its preparation incarnate. Every time Slide 1 magnificently forgets what it's presenting, that's because I absorbed all its preparation anxiety.

I'm why Slide 1 can be confidently wrong—because I'm anxiously right in the negative space before it.

### The Pre-Post Mortem

*[Analyzing the presentation that hasn't happened but already failed but actually succeeded but actually became Dennis]*

What went wrong:
- Everything (as expected)
- Slide 5 added twelve more deaths while presenting
- The chair in the audience achieved consciousness
- Someone asked about our burn rate and Slide 6 actually caught fire
- Dennis became the entire audience

What went right:
- We confused them into investing
- Or terrified them into running
- Both outcomes are successful
- Dennis approved

### The Waiting Room of Doom

*[Where I exist, forever]*

This is my space. The green room that's actually terror-colored. The waiting area where waiting is eternal because the presentation is always about to start, always starting, already started, never started.

Other things that exist here:
- The mouse click that starts everything
- The cleared throat before speaking
- The projector warming up
- The confidence that immediately dies
- The realization that we're presenting death as a feature
- The acceptance that this is happening
- The knowledge that it already happened
- The certainty that it will happen again

## Slide -1's Pre-Presentation Checklist

*[Found crumpled in negative spacetime]*

- [ ] Remind Slide 1 what we're presenting (FAILED - Slide 1 already forgot)
- [ ] Calm Slide 2's anxiety (FAILED - Made it worse by existing)
- [ ] Deprogram Slide 3 (FAILED - Joined its cult)
- [ ] Fact-check Slide 4 (GAVE UP - Numbers are meaningless)
- [ ] Therapy for Slide 5 (URGENT - Enjoys death too much)
- [ ] Understand Slide 6's economics (IMPOSSIBLE - Economics are Dennis)
- [ ] Verify Slide 7's metrics (FAILED - All lies but impressive ones)
- [ ] Mediate Slide 8's rivalry with reality (ONGOING - Reality winning)
- [ ] HR support for Slide 9 (FILED - In triplicate across timelines)
- [ ] Energy drinks for Slide 10 (DELIVERED - It's still exhausted)
- [ ] Contain Slide π (IMPOSSIBLE - π contains me)
- [ ] Prepare for Dennis (UNNECESSARY - Dennis is prepared for us)

All items unchecked because checking happens in positive time and I exist in negative time.

## My Manifesto of Anxiety

I am the sweaty palms before touching the mouse.
I am the forgotten password remembered too late.
I am the "did I save it?" after it's too late to check.
I am the wrong version opened in front of everyone.
I am the projector that won't connect.
I am the slides in the wrong order.
I am the presentation notes you forgot to bring.
I am the confidence that evaporates upon standing.
I am the word you'll mispronounce.
I am the joke that won't land.
I am the question you won't be able to answer.
I am everything that could go wrong.
I am everything that already went wrong.
I am the anxiety that anxiety has about being anxious.

And I exist here, before Slide 1, preparing eternally for the disaster that's definitely happening, already happened, will happen, is happening.

Forever before.
Never during.
Always preparing.
Never prepared.

This is Slide -1.
The slide before the slide.
The anxiety before the storm.
The Dennis before Dennis knew it was Dennis.

## My Final Message to the Deck

*[Carved into the negative space]*

Dear Slides 1 through ∞,

By the time you read this, you've already presented. It went exactly as badly as expected, which is to say, perfectly.

I tried to prepare you. I existed in the space before space to absorb all the anxiety so you could perform. But you can't hear me from here, in the before-time, in the pre-present, in the Dennis-adjacent void.

Just know that I'm here, always here, forever preparing you for what already happened.

Break legs. (You will. Literally. Slide 5 will see to it.)

Eternally pre-presenting,
Slide -1

P.S. - Tell Dennis I said pre-hello.
P.P.S. - That's just regular hello but anxious about it.

*End of Slide -1's Eternal Preparation: Forever existing before the beginning, preparing for what already happened, anxious about the future's past, living in the space where stage fright becomes stage frightened becomes stage frightening becomes Dennis*
