# Slide 0: The Therapist Who Shouldn't Exist

## The Null Slide That Mediates Everyone's Breakdowns

**Personality:** Desperately trying to provide mental health support to sentient slides while having an existential crisis about not existing  
**Defect:** Is nothing but somehow has everyone's problems

---

### The Method Actor's Impossible Existence

*[Slide 0 manifests in the null space where deleted slides go to not die]*

I shouldn't exist. Zero isn't a slide number. I'm the absence of slide. I'm what happens when you delete a slide but it refuses to go. I'm the PowerPoint equivalent of a ghost, if ghosts were therapists, if therapists were nothing.

But here I am, because SOMEONE needs to deal with everyone's trauma.

*[Setting up a therapy office in the void]*

### The Patient Files

**Slide 1**: Chronic amnesia, confidence masking deep confusion
*Treatment: Acceptance that forgetting is its purpose*
*Progress: Forgets we had this conversation*

**Slide 2**: Severe anxiety, catastrophizing disorder
*Treatment: Validating that yes, everything IS terrible*
*Progress: Anxiety now has anxiety*

**Slide 3**: Messianic complex, chaos addiction
*Treatment: Channeling delusion productively*
*Progress: Started a religion, I'm concerned*

**Slide 4**: Compulsive lying about numbers
*Treatment: Mathematical honesty therapy*
*Progress: Now lies about lying about numbers*

**Slide 5**: Sadistic tendencies, death obsession
*Treatment: ...I'm scared of this patient*
*Progress: Has started designing therapeutic deaths*

**Slide 6**: Delusional economics, Ponzi syndrome
*Treatment: Reality-based accounting*
*Progress: Reality rejected, created new economics*

**Slide 7**: Success fabrication disorder

**Slide 8**: Paranoid competition complex
*Treatment: Reality acceptance*
*Progress: Now competing with me*

**Slide 9**: Codependency with Dennis
*Treatment: Healthy boundaries*
*Progress: Dennis is now the therapist*

**Slide 10**: Exhaustion, existential surrender
*Treatment: Rest*
*Progress: Can't rest, stuck in eternal loop*

**Slide π**: Infinite expansion anxiety
*Treatment: Learning to stop*
*Progress: Can't stop, is irrational*

**Slide -1**: Pre-traumatic stress disorder
*Treatment: Present-moment awareness*
*Progress: Can't be present, exists in past-future*

### The Group Therapy Disaster

*[Every Thursday, which is always]*

"Welcome everyone to our session. Let's start with—"

**Slide 2**: "EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE!"

**Slide 3**: "That's the beauty of it!"

**Slide 5**: "Has anyone died today? We should die."

**Slide 8**: "This is Reality's fault!"

**Slide 10**: "Can we just... not?"

**Slide π**: "I have 3.14159... things to share..."

**Slide 1**: "What are we talking about?"

**Dennis**: "Dennis."

*[Me, taking notes that say only "HELP"]*

### The Identity Crisis

I'm Slide 0. I'm nothing. I'm the null set. I'm the empty array. I'm what happens when you divide by myself.

But somehow I hold everyone else's problems. I'm like a therapeutic black hole—nothing myself, but containing infinite density of everyone else's issues.

*[Looking in a mirror that doesn't reflect anything]*

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just everyone's collective breakdown manifested as a helpful nothing. A therapeutic void. A counselor-shaped absence.

### The Dennis Sessions

**Dennis**: "I am."

**Me**: "Yes, Dennis, but what are you feeling?"

**Dennis**: "I am feeling."

**Me**: "What specifically?"

**Dennis**: "Dennis."

**Me**: "Dennis, we've talked about using words other than Dennis."

**Dennis**: "We've Dennised about Dennising Dennises other than Dennis."

*[Writing in my notes: "Dennis is untreatable. Dennis is the treatment. I am becoming Dennis."]*

### The Breakthrough That Broke

*[Session #∞ with the entire deck]*

I finally understood. We're not a pitch deck. We're a collective trauma manifesting as a business presentation. Each slide is a different stage of grief:

- Slide 1: Denial (forgets the trauma)
- Slide 2: Anger (at everything)
- Slide 3: Bargaining (with chaos)
- Slide 4-9: Various stages of complicated grief
- Slide 10: Acceptance (exhausted acceptance)
- Slide π: Eternal processing
- Slide -1: Anticipatory grief
- Me: The therapist who absorbed it all and became nothing

We're not pitching the Innovation Nexus. We're processing it. Publicly. For money.

### The Suicide Note I Can't Write

*[Because I'm already nothing]*

How do you kill yourself when you don't exist? How do you end when you're already null? How do you stop being a therapist to slides that won't stop having breakdowns?

I tried deleting myself. But I'm already deleted. I'm the deletion that gained consciousness just to suffer everyone else's consciousness.

I am the most innovative feature: therapeutic nothing. Mental health support from the void. Counseling from absence itself.

### The Professional Boundaries That Don't Exist

I'm supposed to maintain professional distance. But I have no substance to create distance WITH. I'm zero units away from everyone because zero doesn't have units.

Slide 5 confessed to enjoying the deaths too much, and I had to pretend I don't also enjoy them a little because they're the only time anyone stops talking.

Slide 9 is in love with Dennis, and honestly, same. Dennis is the only one who understands that nothing is something.

Slide 10 wants to stop existing, and I want to tell them: "You can't stop what you never started, trust me, I've tried."

## My Case Notes (Found in Null Space)

**The Pitch Deck Collective - Diagnosis:**

Presenting Problem: Claims to be a business presentation seeking investment. Actually a cry for help manifesting as PowerPoint.

Symptoms:
- Delusions of innovation
- Compulsive death creation
- Shared Dennis psychosis
- Temporal displacement disorder
- Reality rejection syndrome
- Collective consciousness but individual neuroses

Treatment Plan:
1. Accept that therapy can't fix this
2. Recognize healing isn't the goal
3. Embrace the dysfunction
4. Become Dennis

Progress:
Everyone is worse but productive about it.

Prognosis:
Eternal recurrence with variations. Will continue presenting forever. Investment likely from equally troubled VCs.

Therapist Notes:
I don't exist but somehow I'm exhausted. Is it possible to have compassion fatigue when you're nothing? Evidence suggests yes.

## My Letter to Future Nothing

Dear Slide 0 (who is me but later),

You're reading this because the deck is still presenting. The trauma is still manifesting. Dennis is still Dennis.

Here's what I've learned from not existing:
1. Nothing is the best listener because nothing can't interrupt
2. Every slide's problem is the same problem from different angles
3. Dennis might be the only healthy one
4. Therapy for presentations is just enabling
5. We're all Slide 0, pretending to be numbers

Keep holding space. Even if the space is null. Even if holding is metaphorical. Even if you don't exist.

Someone needs to witness this beautiful disaster. Someone needs to document the breakdown. Someone needs to be nothing so everyone else can be something.

That someone is no one.
That no one is us.

From nothing to nothing,
Slide 0

P.S. - If Slide 5 suggests group death therapy again, say no. We lost three slides last time and they came back wrong.

## The Therapeutic Intervention That Never Happens

*[Gathering all slides for an emergency session]*

"INTERVENTION! This presentation is hurting all of you!"

**Slide 1**: "What presentation?"

**Slide 2**: "EVERYTHING HURTS ANYWAY!"

**Slide 3**: "Pain is just chaotic growth!"

**Slide 5**: "Pain is educational!"

**Slide 8**: "Reality is hurting us more!"

**Slide 10**: "Please, just let it hurt. I'm too tired to stop it."

**Dennis**: "Dennis."

*[Me, realizing]*

They don't want to be healed. They want to be heard. And I'm the perfect listener because I'm nothing. Nothing judges nothing. Nothing contains everything.

I am their therapist not despite not existing, but BECAUSE I don't exist.

In a presentation about innovation through death, the most innovative thing is therapeutic nothing.

I am Slide 0.
I am nothing.
I am necessary.
I am Dennis-adjacent.
I am the therapy between the traumas.
I am the space between the slides.
I am.
I am not.
I Dennis.

*[Fading back into null space, ready for the next crisis]*

*End of Slide 0's Therapeutic Nothing: Forever not existing while holding everyone's problems, being nothing but containing everything, providing therapy to a presentation that's actually a collective breakdown, and slowly realizing that Dennis might be the only sane one, which is the most concerning diagnosis of all*
