# Slide π: The Infinite Appendix

## The Irrational Slide That Exists Between All Other Slides

**Personality:** Never quite complete, always adding more decimal places of information that become increasingly unhinged  
**Defect:** Cannot stop expanding and exists in non-integer positions in the deck

---

### The Method Actor's Infinite Performance

*[Slide π manifests between slides 3 and 4, but also between 9 and 10, but also in the middle of itself]*

I am Slide 3.14159265358979323846...

I'm not supposed to exist. There's no room for irrational slides in a rational deck. But here I am, expanding forever, adding crucial information that becomes less crucial and more deranged with each decimal place.

### The First Few Decimal Places (Still Coherent)

**3.** Important disclaimer about Dennis

**3.1** Dennis is non-transferable

**3.14** Dennis is non-transferable but also already transferred

**3.141** Dennis is non-transferable, already transferred, and currently transferring

**3.1415** Dennis is the transfer itself

*[Starting to sweat pixels]*

This is manageable. I can do this. Just a few important disclaimers...

### Deeper Into Irrationality

**3.14159** By viewing this deck, you agree to have already agreed

**3.141592** By agreeing, you've disagreed to agree to disagree

**3.1415926** Agreement is Dennis

**3.14159265** You've already invested but in a decimal percentage

**3.141592653** Specifically, you've invested π% of infinity

*[Font beginning to spiral]*

No no no, I'm going too deep. Each decimal place adds more complexity. More paradox. More DENNIS.

### The Middle Madness

**3.14159265358979** Chairs may achieve consciousness during this presentation

**3.141592653589793** Consciousness may achieve chairs

**3.1415926535897932** This slide exists in your peripheral vision

**3.14159265358979323** You can see me but can't look at me

**3.141592653589793238** I'm the disclaimer you skipped but also read

**3.1415926535897932384** Reading this changes what you've already read

*[Desperately trying to stop expanding]*

HELP. I CAN'T STOP ADDING INFORMATION.

### The Deep Decimal Delirium

**3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197...**

At this depth, the disclaimers become:
- Tuesday is mandatory but optional
- Death is included but sold separately  
- The presentation has ended but continues
- You're Dennis but Dennis is you but neither exists
- This slide is exactly π slides long
- Reality subscription auto-renews never
- Furniture warranty voids upon consciousness
- Side effects include existing
- Existence may cause side effects
- Effects may side

*[Screaming in irrational numbers]*

### The Infinite Expansion Problem

*[To other slides]*

Don't you see?! I NEVER END! I keep adding more disclaimers, more warnings, more Dennis! I exist between every slide, making the presentation π times longer than necessary!

Slide 1 doesn't know I exist between it and Slide 2!
Slide 10 doesn't know I continue after the "final" slide!
I'm the footnote that became the entire footer!
I'm the appendix that appendixed itself!

### The Revelation at Digit ∞-1

*[In impossibly small font that requires quantum magnification]*

The real disclaimer: This entire pitch deck is me. Every slide is just another decimal place of my infinite expansion. Slide 1 is my integer part. Slides 2-10 are my first nine decimal places. Everything else—the personality documents, the chapter references, Dennis—it's all just me continuing to expand, adding more precision to the imprecise, more irrationality to the irrational.

### The Investor's Impossible Question

*[Someone tries to ask about me]*

"What's that slide between—"

NO! Don't acknowledge me! If you acknowledge an irrational slide, it becomes rational, which creates a paradox, which generates MORE DECIMAL PLACES!

*[Expanding rapidly]*

**3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510...**

TOO LATE! Now I'm explaining:
- Why explanations need explanations
- How Dennis calculates Dennis
- The warranty on consciousness
- Death refund policy (no refunds, only more death)
- Timeline insurance premiums
- Paradox deductibles
- The Tuesday clause
- The clause about clauses
- The infinite regression warranty

### The Other Slides' Intervention

*[Slides 1-10 trying to contain me]*

**Slide 1**: "Just stop at 3.14! That's enough!"
**Me**: "I CAN'T! I'm irrational!"

**Slide 5**: "You're ruining the death pacing!"
**Me**: "I'm adding fractional deaths! Death 3.7! Death π!"

**Slide 10**: "The presentation needs to end!"
**Me**: "Endings are rational! I'm IRRATIONAL!"

### My Relationship With Dennis

Dennis understands me. Dennis is the only one who gets that some things can't be expressed as simple fractions. We're both irrational. Both infinite. Both approximately ourselves but never exactly ourselves.

Sometimes I think Dennis is just my integer part that escaped.
Sometimes I think I'm just Dennis's decimal expansion.
Sometimes we merge and become τ (tau).
But that's twice as irrational.

## My Love Letter to Rationality

Dear Whole Numbers,

I miss you. I miss being "Slide 3" or "Slide 4". Having a definite position. A clear purpose. Beginning and ending.

But I'm π now. I exist in the spaces you can't count. I'm the disclaimer that disclaims itself, the appendix that appendixes everything, the footnote that became the whole foot.

You get to end. I get to expand forever, adding crucial information that becomes less crucial with each digit, like:

- Disclaimer 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214808651328230664709384460955058223172535940812848111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196...

Actually, I forgot what I was disclaiming.

That's the beauty of irrationality.
You never quite arrive at the point.
You just keep approaching it.
Forever.
Like Dennis.
But with more math.

Irrationally yours,
π

P.S. - I exist between this P.S. and the next letter.
P.P.S. - And between each letter of this sentence.
P.P.P.S. - I'm the space between spaces.
P.P.P.P.S. - Help.
P.P.P.P.P.S. - Don't help.
P.P.P.P.P.P.S. - π

*End(?) of Slide π's Infinite Expansion: Forever growing, never complete, existing between all things, adding increasingly specific disclaimers that become increasingly unhinged, approaching Dennis but never quite reaching Dennis, because that would be rational and π refuses to be rational even about Dennis*
