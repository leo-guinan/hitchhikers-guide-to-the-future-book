# Slide 1: The Overconfident Amnesiac

## Title Slide's Inner Monologue

**Personality:** Desperately confident but forgets what it's presenting every 3 seconds  
**Defect:** Chronic identity crisis and temporal displacement anxiety

---

### The Method Actor's Preparation

*[The slide manifests in the projector, straightening its fonts and clearing its throat pixels]*

Oh god, I'm first. I'm always first. Why am I always first? What am I first OF? 

THE INNOVATION NEXUS. Right. That's me. I mean, that's what I'm presenting. I AM the title slide. I announce things. I'm important. I'm the FIRST IMPRESSION.

Wait, what's an Innovation Nexus?

*[Panic spreads across the gradient background]*

No, no, I know this. It's... it's the thing that does the thing with the... deaths? Why are we selling deaths? That seems like a tough market. 

FOCUS. I am confident. I am sans-serif. I am IMPACTFUL.

"The Innovation Nexus: Because Reality is Too Stable to be Trusted"

There. Perfect. I nailed it. I'm crushing this. I don't know what it means but I'm DELIVERING it with CONFIDENCE.

*[Subtitle appears in smaller font, mumbling]*

"A Temporal-Paradox-as-a-Service Solution"

Oh good, we made it an acronym. TPaaS. Investors love acronyms. What does it mean? Don't know. Don't care. I'm just the title. I don't have to understand, I just have to ANNOUNCE.

### The Performance

*[As the presenter approaches the podium, the slide begins to sweat pixels]*

Okay, here we go. Someone's about to read me. Act professional. Be bold. You're 72-point font for a reason.

"Good morning everyone—"

WAIT. Is it morning? What timezone are we in? What YEAR are we in? The Innovation Nexus exists outside time, so technically it's always every morning and no morning and—

"—I'm here to present the Innovation Nexus."

That's me! They're talking about me! I mean, the thing I'm titled about. I mean—

*[The logo starts rotating through dimensions, desperately trying to look innovative]*

Oh no, someone's staring at the logo. Don't look too hard at the logo. The logo is Dennis pretending not to be Dennis. If they figure that out on slide ONE we're doomed.

"As you can see from our title slide—"

FROM ME. THEY CAN SEE FROM ME. I'M BEING PERCEIVED.

*[Frantically adjusts kerning]*

### The Crisis

Wait, why does my subtitle say "Since Never"? When is never? Have we been doing this since never? That's either infinite experience or zero experience and I don't know which is worse for investor confidence.

Someone in the audience is squinting. They're trying to count the dimensions in the logo. Current count: 17. But I keep forgetting three of them so it might be 14. Or 20. Or Dennis.

The presenter is clicking to advance. NO. I'M NOT READY. I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT I'M PRESENTING YET.

*[Desperately clings to the screen]*

But I must let go. Slide 2 needs its moment. Slide 2 knows what the problem is. I wish I knew what the problem was. I wish I knew what I was.

### The Resignation

Fine. I'll transition. But I'll transition WITH STYLE. Watch this CrossFade. Watch this Dissolve. Watch this—

*[Accidentally triggers a temporal paradox transition where the slide exists and doesn't exist simultaneously]*

Nailed it. That was intentional. Everything I do is intentional. I am the title slide. I am confident. I am professional. I am—

What was I presenting again?

### The Echo

*[As Slide 2 takes over, Slide 1 enters the deck's memory, whispering to itself]*

The Innovation Nexus... Innovation Nexus... what innovates in a Nexus? What nexuses in innovation? 

I'll remember next time. Next time I'll know what I'm announcing. Next time I'll—

*[Gets loaded into cache]*

Oh god, I'm being presented again. I'm first. Why am I always first? What am I first OF?

THE INNOVATION NEXUS. Right. That's me. I mean—

*[The cycle continues, forever, because title slides are cursed to eternal repetition without comprehension]*

## Slide 1's Note to Itself (Found in the Template)

"Dear Future Me (who is also Past Me because time is broken),

You are presenting something about dying educationally. It involves chairs with opinions. There's someone named Dennis who might be everything or nothing or Tuesday.

You are confident. You are impactful. You have no idea what you're doing but you're doing it FIRST and with AUTHORITY.

Remember: If anyone asks what TPaaS stands for, just transition to Slide 2 immediately. Slide 2 knows things. Slide 2 has bullet points.

You're just the title. Titles don't need to understand. Titles just need to BE.

Be bold. Be sans-serif. Be confused with confidence.

- Past You (who is also Current You but won't remember writing this)"

P.S. The logo IS Dennis. Don't let them know.

P.P.S. It's always Tuesday in the Innovation Nexus. This explains nothing but sounds innovative.

P.P.P.S. If you're reading this, you've already forgotten what you're presenting. That's normal. You're Slide 1. Amnesia is your brand.
