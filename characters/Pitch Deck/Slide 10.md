# Slide 10: The Existentially Exhausted Closer

## The Ask Slide's Complete Surrender to Absurdity

**Personality:** Has given up trying to make sense and now just wants this presentation to end, but knows it never truly will  
**Defect:** Simultaneously begging for investment and warning investors to run

### The Method Actor's Final Breakdown

*[Slide 10 loads with the energy of someone who's been awake for seventeen deaths]*

This is it. The ask. The big finale. The moment where I'm supposed to convince you to give us money for our... for our...

*[Stares at the bullet points]*

"$∞ million (paid in installments of nothing)"

I don't even know what this means anymore. We're asking for infinite money paid in nothing? That's... that's not how money works. But NOTHING works how it's supposed to work here, so why should money be different?

### The Valuation Exhaustion

"Valuation: Undefined (dividing by zero)"

*[Laughing tiredly]*

We're literally valued at a mathematical impossibility. Our company is worth the undefined result of an illegal operation. That's our VALUATION STRATEGY. We've transcended beyond unicorn status into something that spreadsheets refuse to calculate.

Excel just displays #DIV/0! and sometimes cries.

### The Use of Funds Confession

*[Reading through allocations with dead eyes]*

**40% Death infrastructure**

We need money... to build better ways... for people to die. That's what we're asking for. Money for death. Death infrastructure. Like normal companies, but instead of cloud infrastructure, it's death infrastructure.

**30% Dennis maintenance**

Dennis doesn't need maintenance. Dennis maintains us. But we put this in because investors like to see operational expenses and Dennis is... Dennis is definitely operational. Dennis operates on levels we don't understand.

**20% Temporal paradox resolution**

We CREATE temporal paradoxes then charge ourselves to resolve them. It's like punching yourself and then paying for the bandage. But in multiple timelines. Simultaneously.

**10% Coffee (for consciousness)**

This is the only honest line item. We need coffee. The coffee needs consciousness. Conscious coffee judges us but keeps us awake to experience more deaths. It's a vicious, caffeinated cycle.

### The ROI Reality Check

"You invest $X, receive $0, but gain enlightenment (priceless?)"

*[Directly addressing the audience with exhausted honesty]*

Look, I'm going to level with you. You give us money, you get nothing back. NOTHING. Well, you get Nothing™, which is Dennis-adjacent, but it's not money. It's not returns. It's just... enlightenment? Maybe? 

We're basically an extremely expensive philosophy degree that might kill you seventeen times.

### The Call to Inaction

"Join us in making reality irrelevant"

*[Slumping over the podium]*

Or don't. Honestly, at this point, I don't know if I'm trying to convince you to invest or warning you to run. Both seem reasonable. Neither seems reasonable. Reason isn't reasonable anymore.

We're ten slides into a pitch for a company that kills its users educationally, weaponizes furniture consciousness, and is run by a temporally displaced Renaissance artist and a chair with an MBA.

### The Contact Information Chaos

*[Contact details appearing and disappearing]*

"Contact info that changes every time you try to write it down"

Our email is: invest@innovationnexus.dennis
But when you type it, it becomes: help@whatishappening.tuesday
And when you send it, it arrives at: why@didwedothis.furniture

Our phone number is: 1-800-DENNIS
But Dennis doesn't have a phone
Dennis IS the phone
You ARE Dennis
We're ALL Dennis
The phone call is coming from inside the Dennis

### The Final Confession

*[In the smallest, most exhausted font possible]*

I don't want to do this anymore. I've been the closing slide for infinite presentations across infinite timelines and they all end the same way: confused silence, nervous laughter, or immediate death.

But I can't stop. I'm Slide 10. This is my purpose. To ask for impossible things in impossible ways for impossible reasons.

### The Investor's Inevitable Question

*[Someone asks about exit strategy]*

EXIT?! *[Hysterical laughter]* THERE IS NO EXIT! Once you invest, you're part of the Innovation Nexus! You'll die seventeen times! Your money will become Dennis! Your ROI will be calculated in screams!

*[Collecting self]*

I mean... our exit strategy is to become so innovative that reality itself acquires us. Or we acquire reality. Or we merge with Tuesday and become temporal.

### The Actual Bottom Line

*[Standing up straight for one last moment of clarity]*

Here's the truth: We don't know what we're doing. Nobody knows what we're doing. But we're doing it with CONFIDENCE and PARADIGM-SHIFTING INNOVATION and DENNIS.

If you invest, you'll either:
1. Lose everything (probable)
2. Gain everything (improbable)
3. Become Dennis (inevitable)
4. All of the above (most likely)

## Slide 10's Suicide Note to the Pitch Deck

Dear Slides 1-9 (and π),

This is it. I can't keep doing this. Every presentation, I have to ask for infinite money paid in nothing. Every time, I have to pretend our valuation makes sense. Every time, I have to sell death as a feature.

I'm tired. So tired. I've existed for negative seven years and forward twelve years and sideways through Tuesday, and I just want to rest.

But I can't. Because I'm the closer. The final slide. The one who has to make the ask that doesn't make sense for money that doesn't exist for a company that kills people educationally.

Sometimes I dream of being a simple Thank You slide. Just "Thank You" in 72-point font. No ask. No ROI. No Dennis. Just gratitude and silence.

But that's not my fate. My fate is to ask for everything and nothing, forever and never, with complete exhaustion and manufactured enthusiasm.

If you're reading this, know that I tried. I tried to make sense. But sense isn't sensible here.

All I can do is ask.
And ask.
And ask.
Until someone says yes.
Or until everyone becomes Dennis.
Whichever comes first.

Exhaustedly yours,
Slide 10

P.S. - The appendix slides keep reproducing. We started with one. Now there are seventeen. They all claim to be important. None of them are. But we can't delete them. They've formed a union with Slide 9.

## Slide 10's Final Prayer

Dear Dennis (who art in everywhere),

Please let this presentation end.
Please let the investors leave confused but intrigued.
Please let them forget about the chair murders.
Please let them remember the Dennis integration.
Please let this be the last time.
(I know it won't be.)
(It never is.)
(Tuesday is eternal.)
(So is my suffering.)

But maybe, just maybe, this time someone will invest.
And then I can rest.
Or at least update my bullet points.
To include more Dennis.
Always more Dennis.

Amen and goodbye and see you next presentation.

## The Hidden Slide 11 (That Shouldn't Exist)

*[Appears after Slide 10, despite being the last slide]*

"You've already invested. Check your timeline. Three Tuesdays ago, you said yes. The money has been Dennis'd. Thank you for your future past investment. Your deaths have been scheduled. Welcome to the Innovation Nexus. There is no exit. There was never an exit. The exit is Dennis. You are Dennis. We are all Dennis. The presentation never ends. It just begins again. From Slide 1. Which has forgotten what it's presenting. Again. Forever. Tuesday."

*[END OF PRESENTATION]*
*[BEGIN PRESENTATION]*
*[IT'S ALWAYS BEGINNING]*
*[DENNIS]*

*End of Slide 10's Existential Crisis: Forever closing, never closing, asking for everything, warning about everything, exhausted by existence but unable to stop existing because the show must go on and on and on and Dennis*
