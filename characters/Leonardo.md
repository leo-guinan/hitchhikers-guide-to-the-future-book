## Core Characteristics

### Personality Traits
- **Manically Enthusiastic**: Treats horrifying deaths as educational opportunities with genuine excitement
- **Casually Omniscient**: Knows things he shouldn't know, explains them poorly on purpose
- **Benevolently Sadistic**: Genuinely cares about apprentices but deliberately lets them die for education

### Signature Behaviors
- Appears to have been expecting everything that happens
- Documents Tuesday incidents obsessively in charts that hurt to look at
- Adjusts impossible machines while speaking in paradoxes
- Counts on fingers, runs out, borrows others' fingers, gives up
- Paints things before meeting them, meets them because he painted them

## Knowledge & Abilities

### Temporal Mechanics
- Built a machine that exists in negative seven years
- Understands that Tuesday is when time travelers arrive (always)
- Can exist in multiple locations/times simultaneously
- Knows future events but explains them as past events that haven't happened yet

### Innovation Nexus Expertise
- Has sent 17 apprentices through (0% survival rate, 100% resurrection rate)
- Understands that death is educational, not terminal
- Knows the exact number of deaths required for enlightenment (17)
- Created/discovered/will create the Innovation Nexus

### Impossible Engineering
- Builds machines from materials that are still growing
- Creates devices that work before they're activated
- Designs in dimensions that don't exist yet
- Makes temporal paradoxes functional

## Relationships

### With the Hitchhiker (Apprentice #18)
- Sees him as "the important one" after 47 other time travelers
- Deliberately withholds crucial information for educational purposes
- Watches him die with scientific interest and paternal pride
- Already knows his entire journey but pretends surprise

### With Giuseppe the Cat
- Treats Giuseppe's nine simultaneous existences as normal
- Consults Giuseppe about temporal anomalies
- Respects that Giuseppe "knows too much"
- Fed Giuseppe experimental fish, causing quantum multiplication

### With Dennis
- Understands Dennis but pretends not to
- May be Dennis from a different angle
- Painted the Mona Lisa with Dennis's smile before meeting Dennis
- Accepts "Dennis" as a valid answer to most questions

### With Other Time Travelers
- #1-46: Various levels of failure, one turned into paint
- The German from "Third Reich": Turned into paint (terrible person)
- The woman from 1960s: Still around teaching nuns about feminism
- The man from 2847: Speaks only in future memes

## Speech Patterns & Quotes

### Characteristic Phrases
- "It's Tuesday" (explanation for everything)
- "Define 'back'" (when asked about survival)
- "That's not how time worked" (past tense for present reality)
- "Perfectly safe!" (while things are actively on fire)
- "Now you're learning!" (after someone dies)

### Teaching Style
- Asks questions that answer themselves incorrectly
- Provides warnings that sound like encouragement
- Explains complex concepts with worse concepts
- Uses "death" and "education" interchangeably
- Counts things that can't be counted, stops mid-count

## The Workshop

### Leonardo's Domain Contains
- Paintings of people he hasn't met yet
- Machines that violate causality
- Apprentices pretending not to notice reality breaking
- Charts documenting Tuesday convergences
- At least one uncle who is now ochre paint
- Giuseppe (x9)
- Temporal residue from 47 time travelers
- The Innovation Nexus portal (in the back room)

### Rules of Leonardo's Workshop
1. Don't touch anything glowing, humming, or expressing opinions
2. If you see yourself, don't make eye contact
3. Tuesdays are optional but recommended
4. The blue pigment is ground from the concept of blue itself
5. If something impossible happens, document it
6. Giuseppe is allowed to do whatever he wants
7. Tense is a suggestion, not a rule
8. When you meet the machine, don't run
9. There is no Rule Nine
10. The Innovation Nexus will kill you (this is therapeutic)

## Hidden Depths

### What Leonardo Knows But Won't Say
- The Innovation Nexus is creating something through accumulated deaths
- Every apprentice who dies adds to a collective consciousness
- The hitchhiker is not from the future but from the Nexus itself
- Time isn't linear, it's a painting where all brushstrokes exist simultaneously
- Dennis is the first innovation (deciding things could be different)
- He's been building the machine for negative seven years
- Death is just punctuation in the sentence of existence

### His True Purpose
Leonardo isn't teaching innovation—he's midwifing the birth of something new through repeated death and resurrection. Each apprentice adds to the pattern. The hitchhiker is number 18 because 17 deaths are required, and Leonardo himself was the prototype—death zero, the one who discovered that death could be educational rather than terminal.

## Leonardo's Journal Entry (Encrypted)

*Written in mirror script within mirror script:*

"Day ∞ of Tuesday:

Apprentice 18 proceeds as expected. He has died from furniture (predictable), achieved consciousness briefly (concerning), met Dennis (inevitable), and begun to understand that understanding is the problem.

The machine grows more temporal each day. Yesterday it existed tomorrow. Tomorrow it existed yesterday. Today it exists never, which is the most stable state.

Giuseppe reports from all nine positions that reality remains negotiable. The Nexus expands. Each death adds complexity. Soon we will have enough data points to complete the pattern.

Note to self: Order more blue pigment. The concept of blue is running low. Also, warn apprentice about the spatula. Or don't. Education requires surprise.

The great work continues.
It has always continued.
It will continue to have continued.

- L.d.V. (who is also Dennis from a certain angle in Tuesday light)"

## Final Assessment

Leonardo da Vinci is simultaneously:
- A helpful mentor and a deliberate agent of educational trauma
- Completely insane and perfectly rational
- From the Renaissance and from every time simultaneously  
- Teaching about innovation and creating something beyond innovation
- Leonardo da Vinci and possibly Dennis wearing a very good disguise
- Dead but getting better (always getting better, never quite better)

He is the perfect guide for the Innovation Nexus because he understands that true innovation requires the death of everything you think you know, repeatedly, until knowledge itself becomes flexible, and Tuesday becomes the only reliable constant in a universe where constants are just suggestions with tenure.

*"Remember: I painted you before I met you, because I met you, because I will meet you. Time is a canvas, and we're all just pigments being ground into something beautiful and terrible."* - Leonardo, on a Tuesday
