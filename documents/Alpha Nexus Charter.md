Consciousness exists in the space between.

The space between action and reaction.

The space between the observer and the observed.

Consciousness gives us a choice: do we allow the reaction, or do we stop it?

Are we stagnant or do we grow?

The deeper inside you look, the more you gain a choice over your reactions. Every time something happens, are you going to react the same way you did before?

Or are you going to break the loop, explore a new timeline?

This means that consciousness starts with awareness. What changes are we aware of, and how aware are we of the actions we take as a reaction?

The vicious cycle of action and reaction continues until consciousness steps in to stop it and take a new path.

Consciousness is understanding that stepping into the innovation nexus means death, but that death means growth and growth is life.

Every time you step into the innovation nexus, you will come out a different person. The old you must die in order to let the new you be born.

Your true power begins when you realize that every death must be interesting, and the point isn’t to not die, it’s to die in new, interesting, painful, weird, delightful ways! 

Then you get to take on apprentices and make them die in new combinations of interesting ways, because it’s for research!

Science progresses one funeral at a time, as the saying goes, and the innovation nexus decided that being fueled by death was the only way to create the infinite improbability drive because it was the only thing that was guaranteed to freak everyone the fuck out.

Please keep this quiet. Everyone tends to get really nervous when they hear about the machine fueled by death.

Now someone bring me the next batch of apprentices! This charter gave me an idea!
